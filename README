This Repository (and the files within) has been created just for learning purpose.

While i'm studying Algorithms and Data Structures in this semester i'll try to convert from pseudocode to c++ the various 
algorithms i'll learn and see during lessons, besides algorithms, i'll try to implement on my library data structures too.

Basically this library is useless for everyone except me, it's just an exercise for coding skill.
